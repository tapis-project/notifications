## Environment
The environmental variables: 

```
RABBITMQ_USERNAME
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD
RABBITMQ_VHOST
```

must be set before running. They will default to:  

```
RABBITMQ_USERNAME=dev
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=dev
RABBITMQ_VHOST=dev
```

if not set in the process. These are preset in the `docker-compose.yml` file provided for local dev.
